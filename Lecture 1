In this lecture we saw some important conceps before moving to cding part
1) what is programming - programming laguages are needed to convert high level language to low level language that can be understood by computer . 
which helos us to manage our data in a more systematic way.
2) why c++ - c++ is an effiecient language 
            it is faster than other languages .
            we also have conceps of STL (Standard template libraries)
            strong abstraction capabilities
            strong typing and compiler time checks
3) what is IDE - ide is basically where we write code for execution
4) what are High level language and Low level language - high level languages are understood by humarns nd low level laguages are understood by computer compiler.
                                                         for execution of code or any program the human wriiten code which is in high level language is converted into 
                                                          low level language in form of binary .
